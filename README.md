## Questions and Solutions
The project addresses the following problems:

1. **Check if a number is a palindrome**  
   - Algorithm  
   - Flowchart

2. **Check if a number is a prime number**  
   - Algorithm  
   - Flowchart  
   - C Program

3. **Print Fibonacci numbers**  
   - Algorithm  
   - Flowchart  
   - C Program

4. **Sum the following series for n terms:**  
   - (a) \( 1 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{27} + \dots + \frac{1}{n^3} \)  
   - (b) \( 1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \)  
   - Algorithm  
   - Flowchart  
   - C Program

5. **Print the following pattern for n rows (n=2):**  
   - Input: `n=4`  
     ```
        1
       12
      123
     1234
     ```
   - Algorithm  
   - Flowchart  
   - C Program

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main folders:

- **src**:  
  This folder contains the C programs for each problem. These are the actual implementation files where the logic for palindrome check, prime number check, Fibonacci series, series summation, and pattern printing is written in C.

- **algorithms**:  
  This folder contains `.algo` files for each problem. Each `.algo` file describes the step-by-step algorithm used to solve the corresponding problem. These algorithms serve as a blueprint before writing the C programs.

- **flowcharts**:  
  This folder contains flowchart diagrams for each problem. Flowcharts visually represent the logic and flow of the program, making it easier to understand the control flow and decision-making processes in the solution.
